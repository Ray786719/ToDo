## Front End Design

Designed a front-end that meets accessibility guidelines and follows UX design principles. Created a responsive full-stack application that meets its given purpose, provides a set of user interactions, and uses custom HTML and CSS/CSS frameworks.
Used Semantic HTML. No Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) errors found. A user-friendly interface with consistent styles, clear navigation, and adherence to wireframes/mockups. The layout adapted to different screen sizes using CSS media queries, Flexbox, and Grid without any major errors/loss of functionality.

## Wireframes

The application design was planned using **Balsamiq Wireframes** following a mobile-first approach to ensure optimal user experience across all devices:

## Agile Methodologies

This project was planned and developed using Agile principles, following an iterative and incremental approach. 

**Project Planning**

A GitHub Project Board was set up using a Kanban workflow with three columns: To Do, In Progress, and Done.

Each task was created as a GitHub Issue, linked to a User Story.

MoSCoW prioritisation was applied to clearly define what features were:

**Must Have** ‚Äì essential for project success.

**Should Have** ‚Äì important but not critical.

**Could Have** ‚Äì desirable if time permits.

**Won‚Äôt Have** ‚Äì excluded from this release.

**Epics and User Stories Epic**

**1. User Management**

As a new user, I want to register an account so I can access the app.

As a returning user, I want to log in securely so that I can use my to-do list.

**2. Task Management**

As a user, I want to create tasks so I can track my work
As a user, I want to edit/delete tasks so I can manage my workflow
As a user, I want to mark tasks complete so I can track progress
As a user, I want to set due dates so I can prioritize urgent tasks
As a user, I want priority levels so I can organize by importance
As a user, I want categories so I can group related tasks

**3. User Experience & Accessibility**

As a visually impaired user, I want screen reader support so I can use the app
As a mobile user, I want touch-friendly interface so I can manage tasks on-the-go
As a user, I want dark/light theme toggle so I can customize my experience
As a user, I want to search tasks so I can quickly find specific items

**4. Performance & Deployment**

As a user, I want fast loading times so I can be productive
As a developer, I want automated deployment so releases are reliable
As a stakeholder, I want performance monitoring so we can maintain quality

### **Evidence of Agile in Action**

GitHub Issues were created for each user story and labelled using MoSCoW.

The Kanban board tracked progress and demonstrated how tasks moved from To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done.

Screenshots of the board at different stages of development are included below as evidence:

![](docs/images/Agile_Methodology.png)

In the project MoSCoW Prioritisation are Must Have User registration and login functionality, Create/Add new tasks, Edit and delete existing tasks, Mark tasks as complete/incomplete, Priority levels, Screen Reader support, Touch friendly Interface, Fast Loading Times. Should Have Categorise tasks (e.g., Work, Personal), Set due date, Automated Deployment and Performance monitoring. Could Have Dark/light theme toggle, Search Tasks. Won‚Äôt Have Sharing tasks with other users (out of current scope), Integration with external calendar apps (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook)

## Code Quality

All files are named based on the function that file performs. If else, while, for loops are used for conditional scenarios. Relevant comment statements are included whereever needed. 
PEP8 guidelines and indentation have been followed.

![HTML Validator](<docs/images/Screenshot 2025-10-13 15.21.51.png>)

## Documentation

UX Design guidelines were followed. It is easier for a user to have Menu bar on left with a scroll bar to navigate within the app. Dark and Light mode for better visual experience. Bold fonts are used for better readability. 
As mentioned earlier in the Front End Design section, the relevant wireframes and mockups are included.

##  CRUD Functionality

Create - Used whilst registering a new user and creating a new task. 
Delete - Used to remove a task.
Update - Used to edit user and task, complete a task and change password.

##  User Notifications

Notifications are displayed when 
1. When user logged in 
2. When user logged out
3. When new task created, completed, updated, status changed, deleted
4. Before deleting a task.

## Form Validation

Forms Validation used whilst registering a user, logging in and changing password (includes capital letter, numerics and special characters in password).

##  Role-Based Login and Registration

We have two user roles, Admin and user. Admin have access to Django Admin Panel, allowing them to manage users and tasks. Normal users can only access their own data through the web application.

![ Role-Based Login and Registration](<docs/images/Role_based _logins.png>)

## Reflect Login State

Login state is reflected via a dropdown in the top-right corner, showing the currently logged-in user. 
![Login state](docs/images/login.PNG)

## Access Control

When a normal user logging in, we are not letting them access to admin user data. 

##  Python Test Procedures

# Create New Task

Log in (pass) > Click on Add new task(pass) > Add Task name, Due Date, Due Time, Priority Level, Cateogory (pass) > Add Task button (pass).
Tasks finish when followed above steps. If any of them failed, create new task operation would not be completed.  

## JavaScript Test Procedures

1. Theme Toggle

Save preference in localStorage
2. Real-time Search
Filter tasks as user types
No page reload required
3. Task Completion
Mark tasks complete/incomplete instantly
AJAX requests to update database
4. Form Validation
Client-side input validation
Error messages before submission
5. Mobile Touch Interface
Touch-friendly interactions
Swipe gestures for task actions
6. Dynamic Filtering
Show/hide completed tasks
Filter by priority or category
7. User Feedback
Toast notifications
Success/error messages

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**

## üîí **Security & Environment Variables**

### **Environment Variable Management**
Professional security implementation with comprehensive environment variable usage:

- ‚úÖ **No hardcoded secrets** - All sensitive data managed via environment variables
- ‚úÖ **Local development** - `.env` file with python-decouple for secure local configuration
- ‚úÖ **Production security** - Heroku config vars for SECRET_KEY, DEBUG, and database settings
- ‚úÖ **Git protection** - `.env` files properly ignored, preventing accidental commits
- ‚úÖ **Security best practices** - Django secret key, debug settings, and database URLs secured

### **Implementation Details**

# settings.py - Secure environment variable 
from decouple import config

SECRET_KEY = config('SECRET_KEY', default='django-insecure-dev-key-only')
DEBUG = config('DEBUG', default='True', cast=bool)
ALLOWED_HOSTS = config('ALLOWED_HOSTS', default='localhost', cast=lambda v: [s.strip() for s in v.split(',')])

**Repository Security**: No passwords, API keys, or sensitive information committed to version control.

##  Database Development

Data base and Tables are created in Django as ERD(Class diagram) added below.

### **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
![Database ERD](docs/database/todo_app_erd.png)

### **Database Features**

- ‚úÖ **User Management**: Complete user profile with authentication
- ‚úÖ **Task Management**: Full task lifecycle with metadata
- ‚úÖ **Relationships**: One-to-Many (User ‚Üí Tasks) with Foreign Key
- ‚úÖ **Data Integrity**: Primary keys, foreign keys, and field constraints
- ‚úÖ **Timestamps**: Automatic created_at and updated_at tracking

### **ORM Usage Examples**

# Secure user-filtered queries
user_todos = Todo.objects.filter(user=request.user)

# Complex filtering with date operations  
overdue_todos = user_todos.filter(due_date__lt=today, completed=False)
upcoming_todos = user_todos.filter(due_date__gt=tomorrow)

# Efficient lookups with get_object_or_404
todo = get_object_or_404(Todo, id=todo_id, user=request.user)```
